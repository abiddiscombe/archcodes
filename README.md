Thanks for your interest in the code behind my personal website.  
I'm currently learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev); this site and my other frontend projects are useful opportunities to practise! If you spot a bug, or a better way to do something, I'd be interested to hear your feedback.

## Deployment
This site is hosted via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). This is linked to push events and (accepted) pull requests on the `main` branch in GitHub, Cloudflare then automatically runs deployment scripts to serve the content via Cloudflare's edge delivery network.

## Credits
The following resources helped me build this site:
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- [Moving Gradient Background Generator](https://www.gradient-animator.com/)
- [Blinking Text Tutorial](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-create-a-blinking-effect-with-css3-animations.html)
