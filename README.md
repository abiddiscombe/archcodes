# My Website: [arch.codes](https://arch.codes)
Thanks for your interest in the code behind my personal website.

I'm currently learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev); this site and my other frontend projects are useful opportunities to practise my skills away from work! If you spot a bug, or a better way to do something, I'd be interested to hear from you!
