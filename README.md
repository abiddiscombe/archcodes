# [Personal Website](https://www.archiebiddiscombe.com)
Thanks for your interest in the code behind my personal website.  
I'm currently learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev); this site and my other frontend projects are useful opportunities to practise! If you spot a bug, or a better way to do something, I'd be interested to hear your feedback.

## Credits
The following resources helped me build this site:
- [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- [Moving Gradient Background Generator](https://www.gradient-animator.com/)
